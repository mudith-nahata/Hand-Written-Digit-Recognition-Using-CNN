# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-Using-ANN

--> The Hand Written Digit Recognition Consist of 70,000 images in both the training set and test set

--> The Images which Consist of low resolution and each pixel in the row consist as the each input to the input layer in the ANN Model

--> The Goal was to build an Artificial Neural Network and to explore the realms of ANN that how the Neural Network 
    classifies the images and     works on the Multi-class  Classification Problem and acheived the accuracy of 97%
